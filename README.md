# Habit Tracker app

The **Habit Tracking app** is a project I made during my Flask Web Development certification last February (2023). 

By doing it, I learned a lot about **Flask**, **Jinja2**, **HTML/CSS** and **MongoDB**.

It is a simple yet pretty web app that allows us to add and track habits on a moving calendar.

* **Brownsing the calendar:**

<img
  src="/img/check.gif"
  alt="Checking a habit"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">

* **Adding new habit:**

<img
  src="/img/add_new.gif"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">

## Last words
Habit Track was made using Python/Flask and all the entries are saved in a database thanks to MongoDB.
